<p>These are some learning management methods that I have been using to make the most of my time and not just learn things with a ‘first come first serve’ methodology. This has been especially useful as topics to learn have come from multiple mentors and from work on projects – it cannot all be done at the same time and I have had to prioritize. Also as I tend to find myself reading around topics that are generally interesting but not on topic for what I set out to do – this allows me to stay on track whilst bringing those topics into my backlog.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Journal</strong></p>
<!-- /paragraph -->

<!-- paragraph -->
<p>This one was set as a requirement for my trainee scheme, the idea was to note down topics in a reflective manner following the theory,&nbsp;application and reflection cycle. I found that I tended to use this as a retrospective journal more than reflective as it was taking a considerable amount of time to maintain. It was easier to look ahead with learning topics by adding them to a learning kanban (see below)&nbsp;which was easy to maintain.</p>
<!-- /paragraph -->

<!-- paragraph -->
<p>Accepting that the journal would be more retrospective than reflective allowed me to leverage its uses in other ways.&nbsp;I created&nbsp;more detailed entries for technologies/processes/techniques that I had used; where they had come from, and where/how I had used them. I found that keeping track of resources&nbsp;has helped me see what types of resources I find most beneficial.</p>

<!-- paragraph -->
<p>In all I think this method worked well for me but I can see why it would not be so popular with others as it’s a lengthy learning technique that requires some dedication to keep it updated.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Kanban</strong></p>
<!-- /paragraph -->

<!-- paragraph -->
<p>I set myself up with a board on Trello that had a backlog, in progress, backburner and done columns. Just like a standard board learning topics&nbsp;can be added to the backlog to be looked at. I have had a variety of backlog items from researching whole technologies to reading a blog post.</p>
<!-- /paragraph -->

<!-- paragraph -->
<p>Each time someone has mentioned a topic for me to look at I have added it in here so that someday I will get to it. What I have struggled the most with is putting these in a suitable order as it requires some restraint to not put the most interesting at the top. Equally so it also requires some restraint not to just cherry pick the topics.</p>
<!-- /paragraph -->

<!-- paragraph -->
<p>When I have felt comfortable that I have completed an item it has been moved over to the done column.</p>
<!-- /paragraph -->

<!-- paragraph -->
<p>I think this method has given me the most benefits from the others&nbsp;I have tried as it has a&nbsp;very low-cost in time and effort.&nbsp;It is a very efficient way of managing your learning.</p>

<p><strong>Blogging</strong></p>
<!-- /paragraph -->

<!-- paragraph -->
<p>The final learning method that I have used is blogging; more time-consuming than both of the others it is better suited to a few topics that have been challenging or detailed.</p>
<!-- /paragraph -->

<!-- paragraph -->
<p>I set myself up with a simple WordPress blog and have written a variety of posts for anything that I have found especially beneficial. It is a great way of reinforcing understanding as it tests your knowledge to write out an article.</p>
<!-- /paragraph -->

<!-- paragraph -->
<p>You could probably get similar benefits from creating a wiki of learning rather than a blog if you preferred a more technical style of writing. I think that blogging has been a good resource for learning.</p>
