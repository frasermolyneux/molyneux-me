This dish was a surprise to me, Takashi cooked this for me at the Log House in Japan. I call it Japan-Italian fusion purely because of the spaghetti and perhaps the rocket, other than that it’s not really Italian at all.

The recipe is simple:

* Spaghetti
* ‘Mashed’ Tuna
* Rocket
* Seaweed
* Grated Daikon

Simply mixed together the only cooked ingredient is the spaghetti. The dish tasted amazing and was a great success by Takashi!
