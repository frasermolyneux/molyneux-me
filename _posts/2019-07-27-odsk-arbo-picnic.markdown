Takashi works for ODSK which is the "Outdoor Shop K" - they were having an event for their customers and I was invited along. The customers are mainly what we would call 'tree surgeons' in England and ODSK is their supplier for climbing equipment and their tools.

The day was an interesting one for me as only a few their spoke English, I was lost several times in translation in an effort to make conversation.

Highlights were the amazing food which was cooked between the 'ladies' of ODSK and the BBQ by 'K'.

I really enjoyed the games which comprised of throw line games and tug of war using the climbing pulleys to give an advantage to one side.
