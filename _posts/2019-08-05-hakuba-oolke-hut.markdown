This was supposed to be a fairly short hike (time and distance) but ended up taking much longer than expected.

The hike started from Renge Onsen which we drove up to and the hike up to the Hakuba Oolke hut supposed to take three hours.

Due to the heat and our condition it took much longer. We had set off late 12:30 and arrived around 5. Immediately put on the naughty step by the hut master there were some lessons in hut etiquette. (We had known that we would be later than the suggested but not that late).

The hike was mainly shaded but here are the pictures coming up out the treeline and around the hut.
