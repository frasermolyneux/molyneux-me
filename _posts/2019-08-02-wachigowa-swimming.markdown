This is a great place for swimming and camping, we did a day trip here and had a BBQ but I have camped before.

Stunning area and beautiful surroundings. Water is great and it is deep enough to jump from one of the rocks.

It has changed allot in the last four years since I was here last and some rock slides have occurred.
