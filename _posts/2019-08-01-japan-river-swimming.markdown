One of my favourite things to do in Japan is to swimming in rivers. In July the heat gets a little unbearable and today my weather app said 34 degrees. I went hunting with my aunt for a river! (She arrived in Japan yesterday).

First we went up to a swimming spot that I had been to before (4 or so years ago). Unfortunately with the melt this year being so strong the swimming spot had been washed away. Huge boulders that had once sat at the edge of the river were now washed downstream.

We gave up there and went to a spot Karen had been to before next to Gozamatzu camping ground in Lijima, Kamiina-gun, Nagano.

There is a dam upstream that has waterfalls to sit under and have a massage. The pictures are from downstream as I did not take my camera up.
