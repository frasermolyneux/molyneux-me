During my trip to Japan this year I decided to come back to Kamikochi and climb Okuhotaka-dake, the route is a fairly challenging whilst being well trodden enough that itâ€™s hard to get lost.

My trip details were:

* Stay in Matsumoto the day before and travel to Kamikochi in the morning
* Get to Kamikochi, spend some time in the area
* Hike up to Dakesawa hut and stay the night (2 1/2 hours)
* Hike from Daeswawa hut to Maehotaka-dake (3 hours)
* Hike from Maehotaka-dake to Okuhotaka-dake (2 hours)
* Hike from Okuhotaka-dake to Okuhotaka hut and stay the night (40 mins)
* Hike from Okuhotaka hut down past Karasawa hut back to Kamikochi (7 hours)
* Back to Matsumoto
