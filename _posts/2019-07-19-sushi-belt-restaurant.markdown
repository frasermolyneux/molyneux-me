There is nothing like the feeling of going to a foreign country and the thought crosses your mind...


<blockquote>How can I experience the culture if I can't speak the language</blockquote>


Now of course the obvious is to learn a little, most cultures will appreciate the effort and you will be rewarded.

However, for the sushi belt restaurants that cover Tokyo there is no hard requirement, I tried out a few in my stay and rejoiced over the simplicity. Simply was in and announce your presence with a 'sumi masen' and you will be pointed to a free space.

The food passes in front of you and you take what you want, cost is shown traditionally by the colour of the plate.

Simplicity at its finest. Delectable food. Amazing.
