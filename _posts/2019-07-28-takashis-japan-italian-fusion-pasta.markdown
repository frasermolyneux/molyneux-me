This dish was a surprise to me, Takashi cooked this for me at the Log House in Japan. I call it Japan-Italian fusion purely because of the spaghetti and perhaps the rocket, other than that it's not really Italian at all.

The recipie is simple:
<ul>
	<li>Spaghetti</li>
	<li>'Mashed' Tuna</li>
	<li>Rocket</li>
	<li>Seaweed</li>
	<li>Grated Daikon</li>
</ul>

Simply mixed together the only cooked ingredient is the spaghetti. The dish tasted amazing and was a great success by Takashi!
