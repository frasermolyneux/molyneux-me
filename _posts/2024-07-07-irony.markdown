# Irony...

I am currently migrating from Wordpress to a static website to reduce (hopefully eliminate my costs). That's this website, nothing much in here other than a mixture of travel and some tech related blog entries. 

The irony is that I have just read my 'make your CV work for you' entry; how naive I was; successful perhaps. But naive.
