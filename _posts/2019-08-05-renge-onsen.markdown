Renge Onsen is up in the mountains in South Niigata. The setting could not have been more perfect after an overnight trek. Sitting in a natural sulphur hot pool to relax!

I walked away feeling relaxed and all the aches and pains gone. And smelling of sulphur. Really smelling.

I would recommend this for anyone to try, itâ€™s a fair hike but completely worth it and an experience to remember.
