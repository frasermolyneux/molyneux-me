As one of my final meals in Japan I wanted to try the famed Wagyu beef. I found a restaurant that serves Kobe A5 and had lunch.

I have never tasted anything quite like it. I eat lots of steak of varying qualities and this was like none I had had before. The fat content was incredible and the steak literally melts in your mouth. The steak was very rich and although I only had a small portion I would not have been able to eat much more!
